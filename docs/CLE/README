Dependencies
============
- Apache 2 + mod_rewrite
- PHP >= 5.3

Install
=======
- uncompress the archive (or clone the GIT repo) into a directory, which is in some DocumentRoot

- rename following files:
    conf/config.CLE.template.xml -> conf/config.xml
    conf/seo.template.xml        -> conf/seo.xml

  and set what you need in config.xml
  - if you want to use some database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, ...),
    you'll definitely have to set some values in section CLE_Ibdi (database connection settings)

  - if the system is not in a root url (e.g. http://www.company.com/), but in a directory (www.company.com/website/),
    you need to set main/nonRootPrefix to "/website/"

- you'll probably want to add a website theme of yours ... download one, or make one ...
  just take themes/simple/main.tpl as a template, add some sidebar and header DIVs and create default.css with nice colors!
  two files - that's all what you need!

- that's it, you're good to go ... just insert or make some modules and roll!
